The Avant-Garde Studies group is **open to all** with an interest in the historical avant-garde. You don’t need to be a student or researcher to join.

<!-- Sessions for the Summer Semester 2025 have now finished. New sessions for the Winter Semester will be scheduled soon. -->

To participate, simply come along to one of our discussion sessions. You can find a calendar of our upcoming sessions below.

The reading for each session is distributed through our mailing list one week in advance. If you've missed the cut-off point but would still like to receive the materials, feel free to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch</a>.
