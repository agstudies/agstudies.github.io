The AGS study group is **open to all** with an interest in the historical avant-garde - you donâ€™t need to be a student or researcher to join.

To participate, simply come along to one of our discussion sessions, **currently held online** via Collaborate.

The reading for each session and instructions on how to join will be distributed through our mailing list one week in advance. If you've missed the cut-off point but would still like to receive the materials, feel free to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch</a>.
