  <p class="event-title"> Avant-Garde Film Night: <i>Entr'acte</i> and Other Shorts</p>
  <p><b>7 December 2018, 6 pm<br>Birkbeck Cinema<br>43 Gordon Sq, London, WC1H 0PD<br>Free admission<br></b>
  </p>
  <p>The Avant-Garde Study Group presents a series of rarely seen avant-garde short films in this collaboration with the <a href="http://blogs.bbk.ac.uk/bimi/" traget="_blank">Birkbeck Institute for the Moving Image.</a></p>
  <p>We will be screening Ren√© Clair's <i>Entr'acte</i> (1924), a masterpiece of Dadaist cinema co-written by Francis Picabia and with music by Erik Satie. This will be followed by four segments of short films under the headings 'Abstract', 'Material', 'Sound' and 'Movement', isolating key features of the filmic medium and probing its inherent tensions.</p>
  <p>Exploring the intersection between a high point of avant-garde experimentation and the emergence of a new artistic medium, we hope that the Avant-Garde Film Night will be the first in a series of events that extend the work of the study group beyond our regular sessions and open it up to new audiences.</p>
