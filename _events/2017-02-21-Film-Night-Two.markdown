The Avant-Garde Studies group presents the second in our series of screenings of avant-garde short films in collaboration with the <a href="http://blogs.bbk.ac.uk/bimi/" target="_blank">Birkbeck Institute for the Moving Image</a>.<br><br>
This time, the programme begins with a screening of Luis Buñuel’s <i>Un Chien Andalou</i> (1929), a silent surrealist short film co-written by Buñuel and Salvador Dali. Alongside this classic of surrealist cinema, we will be screening a selection of other short avant-garde films that probe the category of the ‘real’ across different genres, including fiction, documentary, and advertising. The event is free and open to all.
