Below is a calendar of our upcoming sessions for this term. If you would like to join a study group session, there is no need to register, simply come along!

We distribute the reading for each session through our mailing list one week in advance. If you've missed the cut-off point for the reading but would still like to attend a session, [just drop us an email](mailto:avantgardestudygroup@gmail.com) and we'll be happy to forward it to you.
