**The Avant-Garde Study Group** is a forum for discussing the historical avant-garde (Futurism, Dada, Surrealism, etc.) as well as other forms of experimentation in 19th and 20th-century literature, art, music, film and performance.



We meet every other week during term time at the Birkbeck School of Arts. Our sessions are **open to all, run collectively and shaped by the interests of the participants.**
