    <p><b>The Avant-Garde Study Group</b> is a forum for discussing the historical avant-garde (Futurism, Dada, Surrealism, etc.) as well as other forms of experimentation in 19th and 20th-century literature, art, music, film and performance.

    <p>We meet every other week during term time at the Birkbeck School of Arts. Our    sessions are <b>open to all, run collectively and shaped by the interests of the participants.</b>
